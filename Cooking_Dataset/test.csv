about vanilla beans,information	vanilla,1 info file,information only,"information from the 1996 old farmer 's almanac , `` what you can eat to achieve true peace of mind '' , by ken haedrich eight to nine months after pollination , the beans are golden yellow and ready for harvest and curing . in the sun or over a fire . using the solar method , beans are spread in the hot sun by day and wrapped in blankets and placed in wooden boxes by night . when you buy a vanilla bean at your market , the black , oily , smooth pod you 're buying is a cured bean . when you purchase a bottle of pure vanilla extract , you 're buying beans whose flavor components have been dissolved in a solution of water and alcohol . by law , pure vanilla extract must contain at least 35 percent alcohol by volume . anything less is labeled a flavor . pure vanilla extracts come in a variety of folds , or strengths . strong , pure extracts , such as four-fold , are primarily used in mass food production . what about imitation vanilla ? stepping in to fill the void is the chemist , who has come up with a variety of imitations made from synthetic vanillin , the organic component that gives vanilla its distinctive flavor and fragrance . most synthetic vanillin is a byproduct of the paper industry , made by cooking and treating wood-pulp effluent . but since vanillin is only one of more than 150 flavor and fragrance compounds found in pure vanilla , the chemist has yet to match the subtlety with which mother nature has endowed the real thing . quality is key . to truly experience all the flavor and fragrance vanilla has to offer , you have to seek out quality beans and extracts . generally speaking , look for beans that are supple and aromatic . tahitian beans are moister and relatively short and plump , with thin skins and a floral aroma . bourbon beans -lrb- so called because they originate in madagascar , reunion , and the comoros , formerly known as the bourbon islands -rrb- are slightly dryer , contain more natural vanillin , and have thick skins -lrb- the flavor has nothing to do with bourbon whiskey . -rrb- stay away from dry , brittle , or smoky-smelling beans . depending upon quality and variety , single vanilla beans retail from about $ 1.50 to $ 10 apiece . do n't refrigerate them or they may develop mold . vanilla beans last up to two years . especially if you cook with it often , it is more economical to buy pure vanilla extract by the pint , or even the quart , and share it with a friend . store extract at room temperature , tightly closed .
